# Haze
 Minimal Discord theme based on my own color palette, "Haze".

 Based on [refact0r's Midnight theme](https://github.com/refact0r/midnight-discord).

 # Installation
 1. Install [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/).
 2. Download [haze.theme.css](haze.theme.css).
 3. Move `haze.theme.css` to the `BetterDiscord\themes` folder:
     - Discord App:
        - Open <kbd>⚙ `User Settings`</kbd>.
        - Navigate to `Themes` under the `BetterDiscord` category.
        - Click on `Open Themes Folder` at the top of the screen next to the title.
    - OR:
        - Windows:
            - Access your `AppData` folder by pressing <kbd>⊞</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>
            - Enter `%appdata%` in the field, and click `OK`.
            - Navigate to `BetterDiscord\themes`.
        - Mac OS: 
            - Access your `Library` folder by opening Finder and pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd>
            - Navigate to `Application Support\BetterDiscord\themes`.
4. Open your Discord app and click on <kbd>⚙ `User Settings`</kbd>.
5. Navigate to `Themes` under the `BetterDiscord` category.
6. Enable `haze vX.X.X` by clicking the corresponding toggle switch.
    - A popup should appear at the bottom saying that `haze has been enabled.`
    - If `haze vX.X.X` is absent, click on `Open Themes Folder` at the top of the screen and double-check that you moved the `theme.css` file to the correct location.
